# Indexes for the vanilla inventory are:
#     0-8  : player hotbar
#     9-35 : main inventory
#     36-39: armor inventory in the order boots, leggings, chestplate, helmet
# If a given index is out of range the mod will attempt to load that item into the first available inventory slot after adding all other items.
